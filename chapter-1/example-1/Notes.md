The old code executed the “while” loop once, the new code executes it three times. A while loop that takes a long time might impair performance. Many programmers would not do this refactoring simply for this reason. But note the words if and might. Until I profile I cannot tell how much time is needed for the loop to calculate or whether the loop is called often enough for it to affect the overall performance of the system. Don’t worry about this while refactoring. When you optimize you will have to worry about it, but you will then be in a much better position to do something about it, and you will have more options to optimize effectively.
